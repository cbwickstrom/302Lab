  ➸ Sec. 32 INTERNAL CSS: one way to insert a style sheet
      Implement CSS code across ENTIRE web page so we won't have to C+P the style attribute each time we want to change a particular element.
        ** In an HTML document, the "<head>" section is the correct place to refer to an internal style sheet**
                Which HTML ★tag is used to define an internal style sheet? '<style>'
        An internal stylesheet holds CSS rules for the page in the head section of the HTML file.
          The rules only apply to that page, but you can configure CSS classes and IDs that can be used to style multiple elements in the page code

      Example ➤➤➤
          <head>
            <style type = text/css>
              body {background-color: blue;}

        Forms + input
        FORM tag tells us what  INTO the form.
            Doesn't do anything until you enter the two imporant HTML elements: LABEL and INPUT.
                ✿ {open} label tag + {closed} label tag is where you enter your text
                ✿ input tag is a self closing tag. Instead, you define the input type by using the type attribute.
                value
                    ▷The input control's 'value'. When specified in the HTML, this is the initial value, and from then on
                    it can be altered or retrieved at any time using JavaScript to access the respective
                    HTMLInputElement object's value property. The value attribute is always optional,
                    though should be considered mandatory for checkbox, radio, and hidden.
